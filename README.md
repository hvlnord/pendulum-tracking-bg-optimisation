This project is largely the same as the main it is forked from, and as such, please consult the original README for instructions on how to use the program. The only differences are in tracker.py, and are as follows: the option to select an equilibrium point for the pendulum has been added, a background subtraction function, which highlights only objects that appear to be moving, is incorporated, and various background occlusion tools to aid with removing distractions from videos have been added.

As with the original code, if you use this code for any academic purposes, please cite the original author as follows:

  howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/supreme-gg-gg/opencv-tracking}},
}
```

Plagarising any part of the code without consent from the publisher is a serious academic offense.
