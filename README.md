This project is largely the same as the main it is forked from. The only differences are that a background subtraction function, which highlights only objects that appear to be moving, is incorporated, and various background occlusion tools have been added.

As with the original code, if you use this code for any academic purposes, please cite the original author as follows:

```
@misc{chiang2024opencvtracking,
  author = {Jet Chiang},
  title = {Automated Tracking And Analysis System for Pendulum Motion},
  year = {2024},
  publisher = {GitHub},
  journal = {GitHub repository},
  howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/supreme-gg-gg/opencv-tracking}},
}
```

Plagarising any part of the code without consent from the publisher is a serious academic offense.
